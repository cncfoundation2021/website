## Development Workflow Rules

1. **Local Testing Before Production Deployment**
   - Always make changes and allow testing locally before deploying to production
   - Ensure the local development server is running and accessible for testing
   - Verify all functionality works correctly in the local environment before any production deployment

2. **Callout Major Changes**
   - Before applying any modifications, callout and explain any major changes that will be made
   - Describe the impact and scope of changes
   - Get explicit confirmation for significant modifications that could affect functionality or user experience

3. **Debugging and Logging**
   - Ensure there are sufficient logs for debugging purposes
   - Add appropriate console.log statements, error logging, and debug information
   - Include relevant context in logs (timestamps, function names, input/output values where appropriate)
   - Make logs clear and helpful for troubleshooting issues

4. **Deployment Platform**
   - Always deploy this project to Vercel for production
   - Use `vercel --prod` or `npm run deploy` for production deployments
   - Do not use alternative deployment platforms unless explicitly requested
   - Ensure Vercel configuration (vercel.json) is properly maintained

5. **Git Push on Deployment**
   - After successful deployment, push all committed changes to the existing `cncfoundation2021` repository (use the established default branch)
   - Keep deployment and git push steps in sync so production and repository stay aligned
